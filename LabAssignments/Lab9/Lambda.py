#Write a lambda function that takes 3 strings and appends them
lambda x, y, z: x + y + z
#Write a lambda function that takes 2 arguments and returns one raised the the power of the other and test it

lst1 = [5, 2, 5, 7, 10]
lst2 = [10, 5, 1, 8, 15]
lst3 = ["deep", "in", "the", "hundred", "acre", "wood"]

#using lst1 and map, return a list that is the inverse (1/x) of each number of lst1

#using lst1, lst2, and map, multiply lst1 by lst2 for each item

#using lst3 and filter, return all words that have the letter r

#using list comprehension, return all words in lst3 that are 4 letters long, then add the letters "four"  to the end.
